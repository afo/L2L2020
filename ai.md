**Cloud Credits**
For students who need computing resources for the class project, it is recommended that you to look into AWS educate program for students or sign up for a Google Cloud account. You’ll get a couple of hundreds of dollar’s worth of sign up credit. Here are the links: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/apply/) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/free/).
