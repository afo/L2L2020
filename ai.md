**Time**: Jan 21 - Jan 31: 9AM-noon or 2-5PM

**Locations**:
* [240 Bechtel](https://wheelerrenewal.berkeley.edu/surge-spaces/bechtel-hall-room-240)
* [242 Sutardja Dai Hall](https://www.berkeley.edu/map?sutardja)

## Course description
The AI track will cover state-of-the art approaches for practical AI application development. We'll cover foundations, computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, generative adverserial networks, model deployment / maintenance, graph databases, and guest lectures will be given be AI entrepreneurs as well as researchers (at Uber and UC Berkeley).

## Background material

#### Python training

Go through the training videos offered by Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS): [https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/python-boot-camp-fall-2016-training-videos-available-online](Link)


#### Machine Learning Theory

Complete Andrew Ng's great Machine Learning course on Coursera (skip the Matlab / Octave based tutorials, complete them in Python if you want): [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning](Link)


#### Install Instructions (Anaconda)

If you've never used Jupyter notebooks before I recommend that you either run code and course material in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), Google's shared notebook interface in Drive.

If you want to run notebooks locally (recommended for simple experimentation) and you haven't used virtual environments or pyenv or similar before, then follow the install instructions here: [Link to Anaconda install instructions](https://bit.ly/L2L-install)



## Readings

To get a good, comprehensive understanding of the current state of AI we recommend that you read (or skim the following books):

* [Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) -- get 2nd edition
* [Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On - Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Hands-optimisation/dp/1838826998/) -- 2nd edition out Feb 11 2020
* [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) -- excellent free, contemporary resource from UC Berkeley (note usage of MXNet)

## Other great learning sources

## FAQ


**Cloud Credits**
For students who need computing resources for the class project, it is recommended that you to look into AWS educate program for students or sign up for a Google Cloud account. You’ll get a couple of hundreds of dollar’s worth of sign up credit. Here are the links: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/apply/) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/free/).
